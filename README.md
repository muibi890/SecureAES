# SecureAES

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm in Python. The code demonstrates both encryption and decryption processes, using input from a file (secret.txt) and storing the decrypted output in another file (plain.txt).

## Files

- **(AES.ipynb)**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for AES encryption and decryption.
- **(secret.txt)**: Input file containing the data to be encrypted.
- **(plain.txt)**: Output file where decrypted data is written.

## Usage

1. Open the (AES.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook in your Jupyter environment.
2. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code.
3. Input data for encryption is read from (secret.txt).
4. Encrypted data is stored in memory and then decrypted.
5. Decrypted data is written to (plain.txt).
