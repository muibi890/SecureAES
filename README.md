# SecureAES

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm in Python. The code demonstrates both encryption and decryption processes, using input from a file (`secret.txt`) and storing the decrypted output in another file (`plain.txt`).

## Files

- **`AES.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for AES encryption and decryption.
- **`secret.txt`**: Input file containing the data to be encrypted.
- **`plain.txt`**: Output file where decrypted data is written.

## Usage

1. Open the `AES.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook in your Jupyter environment.
2. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code.
3. Input data for encryption is read from `secret.txt`.
4. Encrypted data is stored in memory and then decrypted.
5. Decrypted data is written to `plain.txt`.
